	of earthquake data. The main purpose is to easily define Wadati-Benioff Zones for subducting slabs. 
	However, this package provides the tools to visualize any earthquake data. This package, while not 
	fully dependent on USGS datasets, was built with the intention of exporting desired datasets from 	https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/.
